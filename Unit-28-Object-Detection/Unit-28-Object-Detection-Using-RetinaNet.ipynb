    "Recognizing an object from an image has always been a very challenging task. If we need detect multiple objects from the same image, it is even more difficult. Purpose of Computer Vision is to solve such complex tasks. With the emergence of Neural Network driven Machine Learning algorithms, there are better ways to tackle these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection architecture is categorized into two types: two-stage and single-stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two-stage object detectors organize the image into two parts: foreground and background. Then, all the foreground objects are classified into more fine grained classes: car, truck, person, bus, bicycle, etc. \n",

    "RetinaNet, Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection, is a project done by Facebook AI Research team, has proposed one-stage detector with hybrid approaches from two-stage detectors such as Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Mask R-CNN, to achieve the accuracy comparable with two-stage detectors. RetinaNet offers best of both single-stage and two-stage detectors.\n",
